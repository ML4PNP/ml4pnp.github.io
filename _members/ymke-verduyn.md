I’m a PhD student at the Department of Computational Cognitive Science. With a Master’s degree in Experimental and Theoretical Psychology (UGent) and a Master’s degree in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (Tilburg University), my academic journey has been driven by my passion for the brain, psychiatry, AI, data analysis, modeling, and programming. In my research, I aim to move beyond current clinical standards towards precision neuropsychiatry, where individualized treatment is the norm. Alongside my PhD, I serve as the coordinator of the Brain and Behavior Lab, where we utilize multiple devices to measure both electrophysiological and behavioral aspects of brain function, enabling me to connect theory and practice closely.
