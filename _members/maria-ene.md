I am a third-year Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Tilburg University, currently completing my Bachelor’s degree. I am interested in how AI can be used responsibly to support mental health research, particularly in improving diagnosis and in gaining a deeper understanding of cognitive and neural mechanisms. I completed my Bachelor’s internship at the ML4PNP Lab, where I developed a modular ERP extraction pipeline for EEG data. I am currently writing my Bachelor’s thesis on normative modelling of the P600, focusing on individual differences in neural responses. My CSAI BSc has been very enjoyable and helped me discover my interest in cognitive science and neuroscience, alongside my passion for programming. I therefore plan to continue with the CSAI MSc at Tilburg University, with the goal of pursuing an academic career.
