Seyed Mostafa Kia is an assistant professor at the Department of Intelligent Systems, Tilburg University, working on finding scalable, explainable, and reliable machine learning (ML) solutions for applications in precision medicine. The core aim of precision medicine is to find the right treatment at the right time for the right patient, and ML can substantially aid in realizing these goals. In my research, I try to i) use scalable ML solutions on large clinical cohorts to spell heterogeneity in healthy and patient populations; ii) find interpretable ML solutions somehow we can translate the decisions of an ML model into practical recommendations for both clinicians and patients, and iii) exploit model uncertainty estimation techniques for more reliable decision making.
