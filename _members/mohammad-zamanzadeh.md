I am a PhD student in the Department of Computational Cognitive Science at Tilburg University, the Netherlands. My research interests lie at the intersection of biosignal processing and machine learning, with a particular focus on Bayesian modeling. My work aims to develop normative models of electrophysiological signals as a pathway toward precision psychiatry. As part of the ML4PNP lab, I am involved in developing MEGaNorm, an end-to-end pipeline for deriving lifespan normative ranges and performing individual-level analyses of M/EEG data. Prior to my PhD, I completed a Master’s degree in Cognitive Science at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, Iran, where I worked on predicting ADHD using graph-theoretical measures of fMRI data. I also have industry experience as a machine learning engineer at a startup developing cuff-less blood pressure monitoring devices.
