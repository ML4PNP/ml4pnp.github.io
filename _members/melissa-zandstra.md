I am a postdoc at the Center of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, Tilburg University. My academic background combines Psychology (bachelor), Neuroscience (master), and Forensic and Legal Psychology (master), reflecting a longstanding fascination with the brain, psychiatric disorders, and individual differences in complex behavior. During my PhD at UMC Utrecht, I adopted a multilevel network perspective on psychopathology. I studied psychiatric disorders as complex dynamic systems, examining both symptom network interactions and EEG connectivity to better understand heterogeneity and variability in treatment response in difficult-to-treat depression and psychosis. While much of this work focused on group-level differences, both in clinical practice and in the data I consistently observed substantial variability within diagnostic categories. This experience sparked my interest in normative modeling. I am motivated to move beyond average group effects and develop robust, interpretable computational approaches that quantify meaningful individual differences in brain function. Ultimately, I aim to translate these methods into clinically actionable tools that support precision psychiatry and more personalized, sustainable mental healthcare.
