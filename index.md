# Machine Learning for Precision Neuropsychiatry (ML4PNP) Lab

ML4PNP is a research lab within the Computational Models of Brain and Behavior research unit, embedded in the Research Center for Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences, Tilburg University. The lab focuses on developing open-source tools for analyzing large-scale neuroimaging data to advance precision medicine in neuropsychiatry, supporting early diagnosis, treatment selection, and outcome prediction at the level of individual patients. ML4PNP applies advanced machine learning techniques to MRI, EEG, and MEG data, with a particular emphasis on modeling individual variability in brain structure and function through normative modeling and reproducible analysis pipelines.
