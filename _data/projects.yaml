  description: MEGaNorm is a research project aimed at establishing normative reference models of human brain function using large-scale magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data, with the goal of advancing precision neuropsychiatry. Mental and neurological disorders affect a large proportion of the global population and are characterized by substantial heterogeneity in symptoms and treatment response, making diagnosis and personalized treatment challenging. MEGaNorm addresses this challenge by developing advanced normative modeling approaches that characterize typical patterns of brain activity across the human lifespan and quantify individual deviations from these patterns. The project focuses on functional brain phenotypes, an area that has remained underdeveloped compared to structural imaging, and applies hierarchical Bayesian and federated machine learning techniques to large, geographically distributed, multi-site MEG datasets. These models account for key sources of variability such as age, sex, and recording site, enabling robust estimation of normative trajectories of resting-state brain oscillations across canonical frequency bands. To support interpretation at both population and individual levels, MEGaNorm introduces Neuro-Oscillo Charts, visual tools that summarize normative trajectories and provide individualized deviation scores. Validation on large population datasets and application to clinical cohorts demonstrate that these deviation scores can reveal disease-related abnormalities and capture continuous patterns of dysfunction beyond categorical diagnoses. All models and tools developed within MEGaNorm are openly available and designed for reproducible, scalable, and federated use, allowing continual refinement as new data become available and providing a methodological foundation for individualized assessment and personalized interventions in neuropsychiatric research.

  description: This project aims to advance mental health care by using brain signals to help diagnose and predict outcomes of mental disorders. By analyzing large amounts of brain recordings with advanced AI, researchers will create a detailed map of how these measurements vary among people during language comprehension. This approach supports precision medicine, recognizing that each patient is different and requires personalized care. The goal is to find the right treatment at the right time for the right patient, improving outcomes and making mental health care more effective, accessible, and tailored to individual needs while reducing strain on healthcare systems.

  description: Neuropsychiatric disorders, impacting millions globally, lead to significant societal costs due to the lack of early biological detection and treatment prediction tools. The intricate nature of these disorders' neurobiological underpinnings presents a challenge for early diagnosis and treatment outcome prediction. Normative modeling in neuroimaging offers a promising statistical approach to establish a reference for brain health. Establishing normative biomarker ranges allows us to identify deviations that may indicate abnormalities in brain functioning, offering a gateway to further investigate potential pathologies. While behavioral (e.g., for IQ or a score on a depression questionnaire) and structural brain normative models exist, a reliable functional brain activity model remains undeveloped — a crucial gap, given that functional abnormalities underlie most neuropsychiatric conditions. This project aims to leverage extensive electroencephalography (EEG) data from the cognitive neuropsychology department in combination with publicly accessible datasets to create a normative model for brain function in healthy aging populations. This interdisciplinary endeavor will not only propel digital science forward but also bridge it with societal healthcare challenges.

- title: Predicting the Nurse Perceived Adequacy of Staffing Scale (NPASS) Score Using Machine Learning
  subtitle: NPASS
  image: images/photo.jpg
  link: https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/projects/predicting-the-nurse-perceived-adequacy-of-staffing-scale-npass-s/
  description: Ensuring adequate nurse staffing is essential for patient safety, quality of care, and nurse well-being. The Nurse Perceived Adequacy of Staffing Scale (NPASS)1 offers a valid and reliable measure of perceived staffing adequacy, yet it is primarily retrospective and rarely used in real-time decision-making. This project aims to develop and pilot a machine learning (ML)-based system that predicts NPASS scores using routinely collected hospital operational data, including nurse-to-patient ratios, staff and patient characteristics, shift patterns, and ward features. Through a co-design approach involving nurses, hospital administrators, and interdisciplinary experts in AI, nursing science, and healthcare operations, the project aims to produce a predictive tool tailored to clinical realities. The resulting system will support more balanced and responsive workloads for nursing teams and equip hospital administrators with data-driven insights to optimize shift scheduling, determine Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) needs, and improve workforce allocation. Additionally, the analysis will shed light on work prioritization and task distribution patterns during shifts.
