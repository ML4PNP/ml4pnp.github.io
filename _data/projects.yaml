  link: https://github.com/ML4PNP/MEGaNorm
  description: MEGaNorm develops normative models of brain function from large-scale MEG and EEG data across the human lifespan. These models enable individualized assessment of brain dynamics and support research toward precision neuropsychiatry. The project is funded through a starter grant awarded to the principal investigator.

  description: This project uses brain signals and machine learning to support diagnosis and outcome prediction in mental disorders. By modeling individual variability in neural responses during language comprehension, it contributes to more personalized and effective mental health care. The project is funded by the NWO within NWA within the Routes scheme (NeuroLab).
