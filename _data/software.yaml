  description: MEGaNorm is a Python package that wraps MNE-Python and PCNToolkit functionalities for extracting functional imaging-derived phenotypes (f-IDPs) from large-scale EEG and MEG datasets, and then deriving their normative ranges. It allows researchers to analyze large MEG and EEG dataset using high-performance computing facilities, and then build, visualize, and analyze normative models of brain dynamics across individuals.
